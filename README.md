# Hi there, I'm Chinmay Kulkarni! üëã

I'm a **Software System Designer** with over 2 years of experience specializing in deep learning inference optimization and framework development. My work primarily involves enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) through advanced graph optimizations, ML graph surgery, and custom operator development.

I'm passionate about the cutting edge of AI, with a keen interest in LLM multilinguality, efficient tokenization techniques, and novel attention mechanisms.

## üöÄ What I Do @AMD

* **Deep Learning Inference Optimization:** My work primarily focuses on achieving throughput gains for LLMs (e.g., Mistral, Mixtral, GPT-J, Qwen) and DLRMs, through parallel execution, efficient threading, and graph fusion.
* **ML Framework Development:** I develop custom C++ operators and implement graph optimizations (like Matmul + Add, Matmul + Silu + Mul) that directly improve model throughput.
* **Automation & Performance Engineering:** I've contributed towards building tools for ML graph partitioning in Tensorflow, increasing CNN throughput by 6-12%, and automated benchmarking for 25+ ML models, saving substantial manual effort.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python, C++, Bash
* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
* **Specialties:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, ML Graph Surgery, Inference Optimization, Performance Engineering, Compiler Optimizations
* **Tools:** PyTorch Profiler, Chrome Trace, Docker, Git

## ‚ú® Featured Projects

* **GPT from Scratch in TensorFlow**: A comprehensive implementation of GPT architectures, including a custom Byte-Pair Encoding tokenizer, Bigram model, and a full Transformer-based GPT model, all built in TensorFlow. Heavily inspired by Andrej Karpathy's video series.
* **Celebrity Recognition in Videos**: Developed a multi-stage pipeline for identifying celebrities in video content.
* **Speech Calculator**: A voice-controlled application that solves mathematical problems using high-accuracy speech-to-text (99% accuracy with Google Speech-to-Text API) and rapid Python-based query processing.

## üéì Education
